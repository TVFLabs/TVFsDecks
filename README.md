# TVF's Decks

My first mod for Balatro, with a few decks I thought might be fun. Requires Steamodded.

Decks:
- **Blank Deck**: No effects
- **Bonus Deck**: +30 chips
- **Mult Deck**: +4 chips
- **Joke Deck**: Start with 2 random eternal Jokers
- **Chiseled Deck**: Cards become Stone when scored
- **Rainbow Deck**: Applies the effects of all colored decks
- **Patchwork Deck**: Applies the effects of all decks from vanilla

Notes:
- A friend suggested the idea for Joke Deck, so credit goes to them for that.
- This was mostly made just for fun and to practice mod dev. I'm sharing it here just in case anyone else might enjoy it, but don't expect much.
- Yeah, a few of these are super unbalanced. Again, just for fun.
